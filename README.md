# Exploring React and FastAPI Connection

This is a simple project where Iâ€™m exploring how to connect a React frontend to a FastAPI backend. The backend is built with Python using FastAPI, and the frontend is created with React and JavaScript. 

The backend runs on `http://localhost:8000`, exposing API endpoints for data. The frontend fetches data from these endpoints using `fetch` or `axios`. 

Steps:
1. Start the FastAPI backend: `uvicorn main:app --reload`.
2. Start the React frontend: `npm start`.
3. Watch the React app interact with the FastAPI backend.

This setup is my way of learning the integration process.
